## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Understanding psqlpy

See `docs/technical/psqlpy-complete-guide.md` for:
- Installation and setup
- Connection pool management
- Query execution patterns
- Parameter binding ($1, $2, ...)
- Best practices and pitfalls

### PostgreSQL Advisory Locks

```sql
-- Lock an agent
SELECT pg_advisory_lock(hash_value);

-- Unlock an agent
SELECT pg_advisory_unlock(hash_value);

-- Try lock with timeout
SELECT pg_try_advisory_lock(hash_value);
```

### asyncio Coordination

```python
# Event-based signaling
event = asyncio.Event()
await event.wait()  # Block until set
event.set()  # Unblock

# Timeout handling
await asyncio.wait_for(operation(), timeout=30.0)
```

## 🔍 Design Principles

### 1. Type Safety
- Generic message types
- Pydantic validation
- Comprehensive type hints

### 2. Performance
- Connection pooling
- Batch operations
- Efficient indexing

### 3. Reliability
- ACID transactions
- Advisory locks
- Graceful degradation

### 4. Usability
- Clean async/await API
- Context managers
- Clear error messages

### 5. Extensibility
- Handler registration
- Event system
- Flexible configuration

## 🐛 Known Challenges

### Challenge 1: Lock Coordination
**Issue:** Coordinating locks across distributed processes  
**Solution:** PostgreSQL advisory locks + asyncio events

### Challenge 2: Timeout Management
**Issue:** Multiple timeout mechanisms needed  
**Solution:** Centralized timeout manager with asyncio.wait_for

### Challenge 3: Meeting Turn Timing
**Issue:** Race conditions in turn-based speaking  
**Solution:** Database-level locking, atomic operations

### Challenge 4: Generic Type Support
**Issue:** Maintaining type safety with user-defined messages  
**Solution:** TypeVar + Generic with clear documentation
