## 📋 Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Database:** PostgreSQL with psqlpy
   - Rationale: High performance, advisory locks, JSONB support

2. **Async Framework:** asyncio (native)
   - Rationale: Native Python, efficient I/O, good ecosystem

3. **Validation:** Pydantic v2
   - Rationale: Type safety, data validation, easy serialization

4. **Locking:** PostgreSQL advisory locks + asyncio events
   - Rationale: Cross-process coordination, reliable

5. **Message Storage:** JSONB in PostgreSQL
   - Rationale: Flexible, user-defined message types

### Design Patterns

1. **Repository Pattern:** For data access
2. **Context Managers:** For resource management
3. **Generic Types:** For message flexibility
4. **Event System:** For extensibility
5. **Handler Registry:** For message processing

## 🎓 What Developers Need to Know

### Before Starting Implementation

1. **Read These First:**
   - Implementation Plan (`00-implementation-plan.md`)
   - Architecture Design (`01-architecture.md`)
   - Database Schema (`02-database-schema.md`)

2. **Reference During Implementation:**
   - API Design (`03-api-design.md`)
   - State Machines (`04-state-machines.md`)
   - Testing Strategy (`05-testing-strategy.md`)

3. **Use for Tracking:**
   - Implementation Checklist (`CHECKLIST.md`)

### Development Workflow

```
1. Read relevant planning docs
2. Check checklist for current phase
3. Implement feature
4. Write tests (aim for 80%+ coverage)
5. Document code with docstrings
6. Mark checklist item complete
7. Move to next task
```
